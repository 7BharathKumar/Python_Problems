## **Input/Output, String Manipulation, and Comments**
### **1. Input and Output in Python**

#### **1.1 Input from the User:**
In Python, we use the `input()` function to take input from the user. The data entered by the user is always received as a string, so if you want to use it as a different data type (e.g., integer or float), you'll need to convert it using type conversion functions like `int()` or `float()`.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # Convert input to integer
```
